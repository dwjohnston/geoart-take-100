Pretty happy with the progress I've made this morning. . 


Let's talk about the typings. 


They're a lot looser than I would like. Certainly the idea is that for any given LeafNode value maker, it can only be used/referenced in places that make sense. 

What's funny is that there is some tricky typing here that I've done before in my day job, and it seems too difficult when I'm doing a weekend task. 

Anyway - re: the typings, I'm happy to move forward as it currently is, get the thing functional, and start dealing with type issues as they come up. 





So basically I'm happy about how the FE controls are rendered, they're given an array of config items, and render the corresponding control. 
This seems extensible, and if I want to do stuff like 'Only show these controls' or 'group these controls' that should be easy enough to configure with a secondary display configuration. 

So the next part is configuring a logical model in a JSON format. 

Currently we have something that looks like this: 


```
    const planet1Center = new StaticPositionMaker({x: 0.5, y: 0.5}); 
    const planet2Center =new StaticPositionMaker({x: 0.5, y: 0.5});

    const planet1Speed = new StaticNumberMaker(0.0025, "p1-speed"); 
    const planet1Radius = new StaticNumberMaker(0.15, "p1-radius"); 
    const planet1Phase = new TickingPhasingNumberMaker(0, 1, planet1Speed);

    const planet2Speed = new StaticNumberMaker(0.0035, "p2-speed"); 
    const planet2Radius = new StaticNumberMaker(0.35, "p2-radius"); 
    const planet2Phase = new TickingPhasingNumberMaker(0, 1, planet2Speed);
    

    const planet1Position = new OrbittingPositionMaker(planet1Center, planet1Radius, planet1Speed, planet1Phase, "planet1"); 
    const planet2Position = new OrbittingPositionMaker(planet2Center, planet2Radius, planet2Speed, planet2Phase, "planet2"); 


    const planet1Drawmaker = new PlanetDrawer(planet1Center, planet1Radius, planet1Position);
    const planet2Drawmaker = new PlanetDrawer(planet2Center, planet2Radius, planet2Position);
    const linker = new Linker(planet1Position, planet2Position);


    const tickables = [
        ...planet1Position.getTickables(), 
        ...planet2Position.getTickables(), 
    ]; 

    const controlConfigs = [
        ...planet1Position.getControlConfig(), 
        ...planet2Position.getControlConfig(), 
    ]

    const drawMakers = [ 
        planet1Drawmaker, 
        planet2Drawmaker, 
        linker
    ]; 
```



Now the problem is, this doesn't seriliaze by itself. 

Now of course, we could put in `toJson` and `fromJson` methods, and there's a good chance that I'll do something like that, but there is still the question of what it looks like as a whole model. 


Let's game it out. 

What I'm thinking is that it would be an array of objects: 


```
const model = [


    {
        valueType: "position", 
        valueMaker: "StaticPositionMaker", 
        params: {
            x: 0.5, 
            y: 0.5
        }, 
        id: "p1-center", 
    }, 

    {
        valueType: "position", 
        valueMaker: "StaticPositionMaker", 
        params: {
            x: 0.5, 
            y: 0.5
        }, 
        id: "p2-center", 
    }, 

    {
        valueType: "number", 
        valueMaker: "StaticNumberMaker", 
        params: {
            value: 0.0025
        }
        id: "p1-speed, 
    }, 
    {
        valueType: "number", 
        valueMaker: "StaticNumberMaker", 
        params: {
            value: 0.15
        }
        id: "p1-radius, 
    }, 
    {
        valueType: "number", 
        valueMaker: "TickingPhaseMaker", 
        params: {
            increment: {
                type: "reference", 
                reference: ""p1-speed"
            }, 
            min: 0, 
            max: 1, 
        }
        id: "p1-radius, 
    }, {
        valueType: "position", 
        valueMaker: "OrbitingValueMaker", 

        params: {
            center: {
                type: "reference", 
                reference: "p1-center"
            }
        }, 
        id: "p1-position",
    }


]


```

etc. 

Now, the actual drawing seems like would be a similar - but a seperate array: 


```
const drawers = [
    {
        type: "PlanetDrawer", 
        params: {
            position: {
                type: "reference", 
                reference: "p1-position",
            }, 
            radius: {
                type: "reference", 
                reference: "p1-radius"
            }

        }
    }
]

```

In terms of creating typings for this..., I guess it's actually possible - but not neccesary? 
As in a run time checking that the output value of p1-position really is a position, might suffice. Let's see. 


Alright, I'm happy with this, lets go ahead with it. 


In the meantime, I might do some devopsy stuff - deploy this to Netlify, prevent direct commits to master, etc.
