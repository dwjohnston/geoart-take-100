# 2021 - July - 24th 

I've recently moved house, and have been working on [a javascript tutorial series](https://github.com/dwjohnston/javascript-101), so it's been more than a month since I contributed here. 


I think what I'm going to do today is just create some algorithms, do some 'fun work'. 


- Make the 'about thing closable' 
- Tidy up the the sizing generally. 
- Add pause button 




Global pause. 

I'm putting a pause button in the header for now. 

Question is - how should that pause button communicate with the core application logic to pause/resume? 

One option I'm considering is an event subscription model, using something like [pubsub-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pubsub-js). 

The straight forward thing I'm considering is having a 'GlobalControl' context provider. I think I'm just going to do that, for now.
