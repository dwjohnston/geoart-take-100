# 2021 - July - 24th 

I've recently moved house, and have been working on [a javascript tutorial series](https://github.com/dwjohnston/javascript-101), so it's been more than a month since I contributed here. 


I think what I'm going to do today is just create some algorithms, do some 'fun work'. 


- Make the 'about thing closable' 
- Tidy up the the sizing generally. 
- Add pause button
