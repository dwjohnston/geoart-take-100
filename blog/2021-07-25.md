Ok, let's try make some progress today.

Imma add color controls.

Alright, cool, I'm pretty happy with that.

Added a new algorithm, and that was super easy, so happy about that.
It's copy pasty, but that's going to be easy to abstract to utility functions.

Pretty happy with how this is going.

TODOS:

**Easy**

Add prettier

**Medium**
Delete unused code
Move that onchange up a layer
Sort out DNS
Add abstraction function for creating new algos

Add user preference to remember last algorithm.

**Hard**

Delete/sort out that getControlConfig thing
