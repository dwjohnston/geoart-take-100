Ok, today I don't feel like doing any refactoring or anything, I feel like having fun.

I want try the rolling ball animation.

What I'll do is document pain points as I do it:

- the new Tangent data type should be in a separate area
- ~~Looks like I need to declare 'RollingBallPositionMaker' as a type seomwhere else~~
- Need to add the value makers return type, and class instance to Abstract Model Item -
  - SOlution is that this should be declared in the PositionMaker file and then consolidated in the abstract one.

`findValueByKey` should be curried, eg:

not:

```

    const tangent = findValueByKey(
      "RollingBallPositionMaker",
      this.valueJson,
      this.referencedNodes,
      "tangent"
    );

```

it should be:

```
    const tangent = this.findValueByKey(
      "tangent"
    );
```

I shouldn't have to create a new class that is 'StaticTangentMaker'

Hmmm actually a Postition item should probably just contain tangent information
