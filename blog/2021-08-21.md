Ok, today I don't feel like doing any refactoring or anything, I feel like having fun.

I want try the rolling ball animation.

What I'll do is document pain points as I do it:

- the new Tangent data type should be in a separate area
- ~~Looks like I need to declare 'RollingBallPositionMaker' as a type seomwhere else~~
- Need to add the value makers return type, and class instance to Abstract Model Item -
  - SOlution is that this should be declared in the PositionMaker file and then consolidated in the abstract one.

`findValueByKey` should be curried, eg:

not:

```

    const tangent = findValueByKey(
      "RollingBallPositionMaker",
      this.valueJson,
      this.referencedNodes,
      "tangent"
    );

```

it should be:

```
    const tangent = this.findValueByKey(
      "tangent"
    );
```

Turns out I've already done that!

I shouldn't have to create a new class that is 'StaticTangentMaker'

Hmmm actually a Postition item should probably just contain tangent information

It's annoying having to swtich the algorithm everything I hit F5, that should be remembeered.

Controls don't show up with out me defining them. (I think that's probably by defualt, they only show up if there are defaults).

Configuration needs typing.
