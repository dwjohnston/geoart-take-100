Ok, where we're at. 

- Add the paint layers ✅
- Spacing, etc on controls ✅
- Make the 'in progress' message smaller, and closeable
- Allow users to select between different algorithms ✅
- Get it deployed ✅


So making that inprogress message smaller is easy enough. 

So what I really want to do is make the controls more usable - by providing min/max hints for them.

- Make controls customisable.
