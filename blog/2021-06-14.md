Ok, where we're at. 

- Add the paint layers ✅
- Spacing, etc on controls ✅
- Make the 'in progress' message smaller, and closeable
- Allow users to select between different algorithms ✅
- Get it deployed ✅


So making that inprogress message smaller is easy enough. 

So what I really want to do is make the controls more usable - by providing min/max hints for them.

- Make controls customisable.

Ok, so that's done:

The problem you can see now is that it's actually becoming a bit cumbersome and repetative  to generate the various valueMakers, drawMakers, and control hints. 

Especially you can see that I sometimes need multiple levels of normalisation. However, I think probably the normalising function can be improved somewhat. 

However, I have a plan. 

Basically, I'll have some 'higher level' functions that will produce them all. 

Next steps: 

- Fix/Evaluate typings, tests
- Invite people to submit PRs.
