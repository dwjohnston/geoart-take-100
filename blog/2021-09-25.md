What am I doing today?

I could work just make new algorithms.

Or, going forward there's plenty of interesting stuff to do:

- Drag and drop 'build your own' stuff
- Video / image export
- Social shares
- algorithm saving

Ok, I think I'm going to work on the 'magic triangle' algorithm.

That was a lot harder than I expected, and it doesn't work for doesn't work for anything other than a triangle.

For me, a lot of the fun was working it out myself, but I think I will probably, if I'm going to continue, google it.
