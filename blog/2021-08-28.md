- Fix tests
- Put default control hints back in.

Ok - philosophy;

**It is only the static value makers that need control hints**

Anything else (Sine, XY etc, their 'static values' are derived from static value makers.)

Ok, I've got a bit of a problem.

For a StaticColorMaker - there is a single FE control that will provide the entire update for all params, but for StaticPositionMaker, there are two params X and Y, which each need their own Control.

Ok, the solution is - that each 'param' needs to have their own control, for color - there will be one Param that is 'Color' - rather than 4 individual 'params'.
