Today I'm doing a big clean up of the value makers

- putting each into their own file
- Declare all of their parts (name, params, valueType, implmeentation) in one place.

Issues:

- does the updateValue need to be implemented?
-

Ok, well, that was an intense period of hyperfocus, and I think I'm feeling much better about things now.
