Where I left off: 

- Typings on tests are likely broken /tests are broken 
- Needs run time validation on value references
- The value types of params are broken - see the 'i've fucked up' messages. 
- Needs a display overlay configuration. 
- Fun task - create simple sine. 


So I'm going to start with that fun task.
