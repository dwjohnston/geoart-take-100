Where I left off: 

- Typings on tests are likely broken /tests are broken 
- Needs run time validation on value references
- The value types of params are broken - see the 'i've fucked up' messages. 
- Needs a display overlay configuration. 
- Fun task - create simple sine. 


So I'm going to start with that fun task.

Ok, really happy with how easy this has gone. 

The declarative model is working as I'd hoped. Creating new value makers and new draw makers as well as new algorithms was dead easy.

Ok, so what I'm going to focus on is making this a bit more usable: 

- Add the paint layers
- Spacing, etc on controls
- Make the 'in progress' message smaller, and closeable
- Allow users to select between different algorithms 
- Get it deployed



Tasks: 

- Add the paint layers ✅
- Spacing, etc on controls ✅
- Make the 'in progress' message smaller, and closeable
- Allow users to select between different algorithms ✅
