As you can see from the frequency of this blog, I don't have a lot of time to dedicate to this.

I'm actually considering take a week off work to work on it - basically to have some focus time to 'get the hard stuff out of the way'. The idea being that I can spend some time here and there doing the fun stuff like creating new value and draw makers etc.

## Sunday 15th

There we go, my progress for yesterday was two lines in a blog.

Anyway, I think where I'm at is wanting to do a tidy up of the typings, deleting unused code etc.

But like, that's hard and requires concerted effort.
