## Conceptual thoughts: 

Conceptually - I think all 'controls' whether that is a leaf 'actual control', or a composite 'this thing creates some drawables', end up coming in two forms. 

- Standard tree like structures. 
- Some kind of portaling to allow y-shaped and other models. 



## TODO

- Performance fucking sucks
- Make model respond to controls
