**Deployed here:** https://geoplanets.netlify.app/

**PRs welcome!**

**Instructions:** Look at `src/Algorithms` and you can see how I've defined algorithms there. 

Create a new file, make sure you add the export to `_index.ts` and that'll do the trick!




## Hacktoberfest Guidelines

### Easy(ish) 

Suitable if you can code, but you perhaps don't understand all of the code here. 

Create a new algorithm in `src/Algorithms`. I'll accept the PR if your algorithm is good. 

### Medium 

- Create new value makers. 
- Create docs. 

### Hard/Advanced

The following require a decent amount of experience and likely time and effort. I'm not really expecting anyone to do these, unless you're really into the project. 

- Help solve some of the @tsignores I have around the place. 
- Make the site mobile friendly. 
- (Details coming for some of these).
